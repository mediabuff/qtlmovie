#  Windows PowerShell script to build the documentation using Doxygen.
# 
#  See http://www.doxygen.org/download.html for Doxygen binary installers
#  for Windows. The installer updates %Path% to include the Doxygen binary

 .SYNOPSIS

  Build the project documentation using Doxygen.

 .DESCRIPTION

  Build the project documentation using Doxygen.

 .PARAMETER NoOpen

  Do not open the generated documentation. By default, run the default HTML
  browser on the generated documentation hom page.

 .PARAMETER NoPause

  Do not wait for the user to press <enter> at end of execution. By default,
  execute a "pause" instruction at the end of execution, which is useful
  when the script was run from Windows Explorer.

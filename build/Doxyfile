# All directories containing generated files start with build-
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = ../build-doxygen

# Source files are in src
FULL_PATH_NAMES = NO
INPUT = ../src

# Extract all definitions. Also recognizes Qt slots and signals.
EXTRACT_ALL = YES
EXTRACT_PRIVATE = YES
EXTRACT_STATIC = YES

# Macro names that are defined before the preprocessor is started.

# Do not generate LaTex output.
GENERATE_LATEX = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc
# comments will behave just like regular Qt-style comments
# (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief description.)

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF = YES

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or enum
# is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So
# typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct
# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file,
# namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically
# be useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound
# types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.

TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT = YES

# If the SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES tag is set to YES (the default) then Doxygen
# will put a list of the files that are included by a file in the documentation
# of that file.

SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES = NO

# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then doxygen
# will sort the (detailed) documentation of file and class members
# alphabetically by member name. If set to NO the members will appear in
# declaration order.

SORT_MEMBER_DOCS = NO

# If the SORT_BRIEF_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the
# brief documentation of file, namespace and class members alphabetically
# by member name. If set to NO (the default) the members will appear in
# declaration order.

SORT_BRIEF_DOCS = YES

# If the SORT_MEMBERS_CTORS_1ST tag is set to YES then doxygen
# will sort the (brief and detailed) documentation of class members so that
# constructors and destructors are listed first. If set to NO (the default)
# the constructors will appear in the respective orders defined by
# SORT_MEMBER_DOCS and SORT_BRIEF_DOCS.
# This tag will be ignored for brief docs if SORT_BRIEF_DOCS is set to NO
# and ignored for detailed docs if SORT_MEMBER_DOCS is set to NO.

SORT_MEMBERS_CTORS_1ST = YES

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated
# by doxygen. Possible values are YES and NO. If left blank NO is used.

QUIET = YES

# The WARN_NO_PARAMDOC option can be enabled to get warnings for
# functions that are documented, but have no documentation for their parameters
# or return value. If set to NO (the default) doxygen will only warn about
# wrong or incomplete parameter documentation, but not about the absence of
# documentation.

WARN_NO_PARAMDOC = YES

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to turn specify whether or not subdirectories
# should be searched for input files as well. Possible values are YES and NO.
# If left blank NO is used.

RECURSIVE = YES

# If the VERBATIM_HEADERS tag is set to YES (the default) then Doxygen
# will generate a verbatim copy of the header file for each class for
# which an include is specified. Set to NO to disable this.

VERBATIM_HEADERS = NO

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading
# style sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to
# fine-tune the look of the HTML output. If the tag is left blank doxygen
# will generate a default style sheet. Note that doxygen will try to copy
# the style sheet file to the HTML output directory, so don't put your own
# style sheet in the HTML output directory as well, or it will be erased!

HTML_STYLESHEET = Doxygen.css

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information.
# If the tag value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated
# containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that
# is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports
# JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required (i.e. any modern browser).
# Windows users are probably better off using the HTML help feature.
# Since the tree basically has the same information as the tab index you
# could consider to set DISABLE_INDEX to NO when enabling this option.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW = YES

# The ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE tag can be used to set the number of enum values
# (range [0,1..20]) that doxygen will group on one line in the generated HTML
# documentation. Note that a value of 0 will completely suppress the enum
# values from appearing in the overview section.

ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE = 1

QtlMovie Change Log
===================

Version 1.2.9
- Windows executable is now statically linked and the installer no longer
  embeds Qt DLL's.

Version 1.2.8 (2013-13-27)
- Fixed a performance problem when opening a file without Closed Captions. The
  search for the presence of CC delayed the display of the other streams. Now,
  all other streams are displayed at once. The (unsuccessful) search for CC
  completes in the background.
- Added a "release notes" viewer from menu "Help".

Version 1.2.7 (2013-13-26)
- Help files are now fully translated. QtlMovie can work completely in another
  language. Current translations are English and French. Native speakers will
  be required for additional languages.

Version 1.2.6 (2013-13-22)
- Bug fix: On Windows, if the output file name contained a single quote (')
  and text subtitles from the input file were inserted in the output file,
  the conversion failed. Fixed.
- Fixed typos in help files and translations.
- Added check for a new version either when the application starts (can be
  disabled in the settings) or manually from the "Help" menu.

Version 1.2.5 (2013-13-21)
- US Closed Captions subtitles (CEA-608/708) are now supported thanks to
  the integration of CCExtractor. Currently, the CC are numbered as follow:
  1: channel 1, field 1, 2: channel 1, field 2, 3: channel 2, field 1,
  4: channel 2, field 2. This may not be ideal. Feedback from US users required.
- Bug fix: On Windows, enforce the DVD burner device to be a drive name.

Version 1.2.4 (2013-10-19)
- Encoding for DVD now transcodes audio to AC-3 instead of MPEG-2 Audio Layer 2.
- When encoding for DVD, if the input video stream is already DVD-compliant,
  do not re-encode video. Simply re-encode audio and remux. This is useful
  for video files from analog-to-digital acquisition cards which produce
  DVD-compliant files with MPEG-2 audio instead of AC-3. Previously, the
  re-encoding was skipped only if the complete file was DVD_compliant.
- Automatic detection DVD-compliant files (full file or video only) can be
  disabled in the settings. This is useful to force a transcoding when the
  file seems DVD-compliant but is not really (too large for instance).
- QtlMovie is now internationalized. The current only maintained translation
  is French. Looking for volunteers for other languages. Help files are not
  yet translated. The system locale is used by default (when supported by
  QtlMovie). Another locale can be specified on the command line. Example:
  "QtlMovie -l en" starts in English.
- Bug fix: When editing the input or output file name, the cursor jumped to
  the end of line after each character. Fixed.

Version 1.2.3 (2013-10-16)
- Bug fix: "Test Audio" feature was not working well. Fixed.
- Workaround for a bug in ffmpeg on Windows: When the option -passlogfile
  contains non-ASCII characters, the path of the log file as built by
  ffmpeg is wrong and ffmpeg fails with "no such file or directory".
  Now use the DOS 8.3 short path of the temporary directory for
  temporary ffmpeg pass log files.

Version 1.2.2 (2013-10-14)
- Bug fix: When a file was dragged/dropped into the edit box for input file,
  output file or subtitle file and not otherwise edited, the application was
  not properly notified and the file was ignored.
- Added settings to specify the video bitrate for iPad. The default value
  remains 2.5 Mb/s.
- Added settings to specify the iPad screen size (iPad 1/2/mini vs. iPad 3/4).
- Windows installer now integrates official telxcc v 2.5.1 (required to support
  M2TS files, previous version of QtlMovie used a patched version of telxcc).

Version 1.2.1 (2013-10-12)
- Added settings to create NTSC or PAL DVD.

Version 1.2.0 (2013-10-11)
- Improved help files.
- Support M2TS input files.
- Fixed deployment problem on Windows.
  The Qt DLL's which were copied still referenced the hardcoded path the Qt
  build environment. Now the installer includes the required Qt plugins.

QtlMovie Change Log
===================

Version 1.2.3 (2013-10-16)
- Bug fix: "Test Audio" feature was not working well. Fixed.
- Workaround for a bug in ffmpeg on Windows: When the option -passlogfile
  contains non-ASCII characters, the path of the log file as built by
  ffmpeg is wrong and ffmpeg fails with "no such file or directory".
  Now use the DOS 8.3 short path of the temporary directory for
  temporary ffmpeg pass log files.

Version 1.2.2 (2013-10-14)
- Bug fix: When a file was dragged/dropped into the edit box for input file,
  output file or subtitle file and not otherwise edited, the application was
  not properly notified and the file was ignored.
- Added settings to specify the video bitrate for iPad. The default value
  remains 2.5 Mb/s.
- Added settings to specify the iPad screen size (iPad 1/2/mini vs. iPad 3/4).
- Windows installer now integrates official telxcc v 2.5.1 (required to support
  M2TS files, previous version of QtlMovie used a patched version of telxcc).

Version 1.2.1 (2013-10-12)
- Added settings to create NTSC or PAL DVD.

Version 1.2.0 (2013-10-11)
- Improved help files.
- Support M2TS input files.
- Fixed deployment problem on Windows.
  The Qt DLL's which were copied still referenced the hardcoded path the Qt
  build environment. Now the installer includes the required Qt plugins.

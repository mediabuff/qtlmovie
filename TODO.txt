=====================
QtlMovie "to do" list
=====================

- Fix "-threads" option, "auto" does not seem to work.
  Message: [AVFilterGraph @ 0000000002563c80] Unable to parse option value "auto"
  Maybe a positioning problem for option.
  -> Implement a portable way (Linux/Windows) to get the number of CPU.

- Settings / DVD Burner / Browse on Windows -> make sure to select "My Computer"
  as initial directory. Seems due to a Qt bug (or missing feature). For more
  details, see https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-33962

- Integrate DVD Decrypter: Directly rip DVD. Try to read VOB. In case of error,
  load stream desc from IFO only. Then add an initial DVD Decrypter pass in the
  transcoding job.

- Add a "batch" mechanism. Several jobs are edited separately. The main window
  contains a list of jobs. "Start" means starting the queue.

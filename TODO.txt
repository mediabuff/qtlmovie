=====================
QtlMovie "to do" list
=====================

- Settings / DVD Burner / Browse on Windows -> make sure to select "My Computer"
  as initial directory. Seems due to a Qt bug (or missing feature). For more
  details, see https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-33962

- Add a "batch" mechanism. Several jobs are edited separately. The main window
  contains a list of jobs. "Start" means starting the queue.

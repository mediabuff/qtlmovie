=====================
QtlMovie "to do" list
=====================

- Settings / DVD Burner / Browse on Windows -> make sure to select "My Computer"
  as initial directory.

- Fix "Audio Test" features. Does not always work.

- Integrate DVD Decrypter: Directly rip DVD. Try to read VOB. In case of error,
  load stream desc from IFO only. Then add an initial DVD Decrypter pass in the
  transcoding job.

- Add a "batch" mechanism. Several jobs are edited separately. The main window
  contains a list of jobs. "Start" means starting the queue.

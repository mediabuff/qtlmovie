=====================
QtlMovie "to do" list
=====================

- Check if MP2 is a valid audio for NTSC DVD. Otherwise, use AC-3 for DVD.
  Test PAL DVD with AC-3 on DVD player (take care of DVD Author options).
  Accept MP2 track as DVD-compliant if default is PAL. Check actual audio stream
  type of DVD-compliant MPEG files (again, take care of DVD Author options).

- Integrate CCextractor: Support for North American EIA-608/708 Closed Caption.
  Need some stream samples to test first.

- Implement multi-language help files (file qtlmovie_fr.html for instance).

- Settings / DVD Burner / Browse on Windows -> make sure to select "My Computer"
  as initial directory. Seems due to a Qt bug (or missing feature). For more
  details, see https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-33962

- Integrate DVD Decrypter: Directly rip DVD. Try to read VOB. In case of error,
  load stream desc from IFO only. Then add an initial DVD Decrypter pass in the
  transcoding job.

- Add a "batch" mechanism. Several jobs are edited separately. The main window
  contains a list of jobs. "Start" means starting the queue.

Usage: ./telxcc [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT] [-h] [-v] [-p PAGE] [-t TID] [-f OFFSET] [-n] [-1] [-c] [-s [REF]]
  -i INPUT    transport stream (- = STDIN, default STDIN)

  -h          this help text
  -v          be verbose
  -p PAGE     teletext page number carrying closed captions
  -t TID      transport stream PID of teletext data sub-stream
              if the value of 8192 is specified, the first suitable stream will be used
  -f OFFSET   subtitles offset in seconds
  -n          do not print UTF-8 BOM characters to the file

Download ccextractor source code at:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ccextractor/files/ccextractor/0.69/ccextractor.src.0.69.zip

Unzip, then:
  cd ccextractor.0.69/mac
  ./build.command

Notes:
- Version 0.69 is not the latest one but more recent versions broke the command line
  syntax. Modifications of QtlMovie are required to adapt to more recent versions.
- With version 0.79, build.command is broken. Add "-L/usr/lib" at the end of line.
  Then execute build.command. Many warnings are reported and a final error about
  "-L/usr/lib" (but do not remove it). Anyway, ccextractor is built.

Download ccextractor source code at:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ccextractor/files/ccextractor/0.79/ccextractor.src.0.79.zip

Unzip, then:
  cd ccextractor.0.79/mac

Edit file build.command, add "-L/usr/lib" at the end of line. Then execute build.command.
Many warnings are reported and a final error about "-L/usr/lib" (but do not remove it).
Anyway, ccextractor is built.

QtlMovie Source Code
--------------------

The files QtlMovie-*-src.zip contain a snapshot of the corresponding
version of the source code and all build scripts of QtlMovie.

The latest developments in the source code are available in the git repository
at <http://sourceforge.net/p/qtlmovie/code/>

The files QtlMovie-*-wintools.zip contain the Windows binaries of the
media tools which are used by QtlMovie. If you plan to rebuild QtlMovie
on Linux and other non-Windows platforms, you do not need these files.
In this case, the media tools shall be installed through your distro
repository mechanisms.

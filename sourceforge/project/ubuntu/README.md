QtlMovie DEB packages for Ubuntu Linux (64 bits)
------------------------------------------------

The DEB package can be installed on Ubuntu amd64. It contains only QtlMovie.
The media tools which are used by QtlMovie must be installed first (the
dependencies are managed by the dpkg package manager).

On Ubuntu version 15 and higher, FFmpeg can be installed from the standard
repositories. On older versions of Ubuntu, FFmpeg shall be installed from
the [Jon Severinsson's PPA](https://launchpad.net/~jon-severinsson/+archive/ffmpeg).

CCExtractor and telxcc are not present in standard repositories, use the DEB
packages which are available in this directory. All other media tools will be
installed from the standard Ubuntu repositories.

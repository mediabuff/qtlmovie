QtlMovie packages for Mac OS X (Intel 64 bits)
----------------------------------------------

The package QtlMovie-{version}.dmg is installed the same way as most Mac
applications. Double-click on the .dmg file to open the disk image. In
the Finder window which is opened, drag and drop "QtlMovie" into
"Applications". Then, close the Finder windows, right-click on the
desktop icon for "QtlMovie" and select "Eject". Now QtlMovie can be
started from the Launcher and optionally locked on the Dock.

The package QtlMovie-{version}.dmg includes the executable files for the
various media tools which are used by QtlMovie (FFmpeg, DVD Author, telxcc,
mkisofs and growisofs). These tools are installed within the installation
directory tree of QtlMovie. You may point to alternative versions of these
tools using the QtlMovie settings.

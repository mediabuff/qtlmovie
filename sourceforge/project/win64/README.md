QtlMovie Binary Installers for Windows (64 bits)
------------------------------------------------

The binary installer QtlMovie-Win64-{version}.exe includes the executable
files for the various media tools which are used by QtlMovie (FFmpeg, DVD
Author, telxcc, mkisofs and growisofs). These tools are installed within
the installation directory tree of QtlMovie. You may point to alternative
versions of these tools using the QtlMovie settings.

The binary installer requires administration privileges to install QtlMovie
on the system. For users without such privileges, use the "standalone"
archive QtlMovie-Win64-Standalone-{version}.zip. Unzip it anywhere at
simply run QtlMovie.exe.

This installer includes a 64-bit version of ffmpeg which is faster than
the 32-bit version on 64-bit systems. All other executables (QtlMovie,
the other media tools and the installer itself) are 32-bit executables.

Because of the 64-bit version of ffmpeg, this installer is reserved to
64-bit systems. For 32-bit systems, use the 32-bit installer in
[win32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtlmovie/files/win32/).

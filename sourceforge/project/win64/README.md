QtlMovie Binary Installers for Windows (64 bits)
------------------------------------------------

The binary installer includes the executable files for the various media
tools which are used by QtlMovie (FFmpeg, DVD Author, telxcc, mkisofs and
growisofs). These tools are installed within the installation directory
tree of QtlMovie. You may point to alternative versions of these tools
using the QtlMovie settings.

This installer includes a 64-bit version of ffmpeg which is faster than
the 32-bit version on 64-bit systems. All other executables (QtlMovie,
the other media tools and the installer itself) are 32-bit executables.

Because of the 64-bit version of ffmpeg, this installer is reserved to
64-bit systems. For 32-bit systems, use the 32-bit installer in
[win32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtlmovie/files/win32/).
